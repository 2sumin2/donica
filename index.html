            HuffPost Highline is a digital magazine of investigative journalism. Its stories are intended to change the
            way you see
            the world or influence the course of policy—stories that stay with you. As Creative Director, I updated the
            Highline
            brand identity and website experience, worked with internal teams to build audience engagement and
            accessibility, and
            oversaw art and design for our stories.

            Condé Nast Traveler relaunched their website with a new approach to their content and a design refresh to go
            along with
            it. This vision work was used as inspiration for the internal team working on the redesign. Leveraging CNT’s
            incredibly
            rich content library, we married moments of bold imagery with subtle graphic details to design an experience
            meant to
            feel like a curated gallery of travel destinations.

            Mary Review is a magazine of news and ideas written and produced entirely by women. Our goal was to bring
            parity to the
            wider journalistic conversation. Initially funded by Kickstarter, Mary grew from print and online content to
            events and
            fundraisers supporting women's rights affected by the political climate. As Design Director, I was
            responsible
            for the
            identity, print edition, website, editorial art direction, fundraising decks, marketing collateral, and
            overall brand
            aesthetic. In 2016, our website was selected for permanent inclusion in the Library of Congress Web
            Archives.

            The Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) supports international education, health a class="eye"nd emergency
            response programs,
            and engages
            in global advocacy initiatives with the goal of improving the quality of life for children. It was founded
            by
            Rihanna in
            honor of her grandparents.

            In 2017, our team worked on repositioning the non-profit as a strategic organization with roots and
            momentum.
            We
            proposed ways in which the CLF team could engage Rihanna's fan base, and redesigned their website to foster
            engagement
            and individual donations. Our studio team shot 360 video footage and photography with Roc Nation in Malawi.
            As
            Art
            Director, I led the rebrand of the CLF identity, proposing a dynamic logo and visual system that mirrored
            the
            youthful
            energy of the children supported by the foundation.

            Marriott Hotels repositioned themselves as an innovative travel company and launched a multi-channel
            campaign
            to
            communicate their new POV. We were tasked with creating a responsive website that could communicate their
            new
            brand
            positioning with content that can be repurposed and distributed throughout their digital ecosystem.

            We developed Marriott Magazine—a quarterly digital magazine catered to the modern traveler. We leveraged
            Marriott's
            brand recognition to book interviews with well-known people like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and integrated quality
            video and
            photography assets by collaborating with existing partners TED and VSCO. The Wordpress-based solution was
            designed as a
            modular system of templates to maximize flexibility of content within their budget. Our team also found
            unique
            ways to
            integrate booking flows within each article type. As Art Director, I oversaw the design of the platform from
            concept to
            production.

            North is a location-based mobile app that helps you discover meaningful places in nature through the stories
            of others.
            By aggregating locations and personal experiences from its users, North creates a curated database of places
            in nature
            from around the world. While we often fault the digital world for our lack of engagement with the outdoors,
            North
            explores how technology can be used to bring us closer to nature.

            This concept project was developed over one year and is comprised of a business plan, identity and visual
            design,
            experience design, pitch book, marketing materials, video, and a public pitch presentation as thesis
            requirements of the
            MFA Design Entrepreneurship program at the School of Visual Arts.
